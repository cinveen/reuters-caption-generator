## Quick Start

### For End Users (Photographers)

1. **Extract the folder** you received
2. **Open `START_HERE.md`** and follow the instructions for your OS
3. **macOS users**: Go to `setup-mac/` folder
4. **Windows users**: Go to `setup-windows/` folder
5. **Double-click setup** script (one-time, 5-10 minutes)
6. **Double-click start** script to use the app!

### For Developers

See the **Installation** section below.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (tested on 3.9+)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **~2GB disk space** (for Whisper Large model and dependencies)

## Installation (For Developers)

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

**macOS:**
```bash
cd setup-mac
bash setup.command
```

**Windows:**
```bash
cd setup-windows
setup.bat
```

This installs all dependencies and downloads the Whisper Large model.

### Manual Installation

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

2. **Download Whisper Large model:**
```bash
python -c "import whisper; whisper.load_model('large')"
```

3. **Configure API access:**

Create `backend/.env`:
```
LITELLM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
LITELLM_API_URL=https://litellm.int.thomsonreuters.com
WHISPER_MODEL=large
PORT=8000
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

**Note:** You must have access to Thomson Reuters internal LiteLLM instance.

## Running the Application

### Easy Launch

**macOS:**
```bash
# From setup-mac/ folder
./start.command
```

**Windows:**
```bash
# From setup-windows/ folder
start.bat
```

A native window opens with the app. Close the window to shut everything down.

### Manual Launch

```bash
python launcher.py
```

## Usage Guide

### For Photographers

**Step 1: Record Your Description**
- Click the large "Start Recording" button
- Speak naturally about your photo:
  - Who is in the photo (names, titles)
  - What is happening (action, scene)
  - Where it was taken (specific location, city, country)
  - When it was taken (date, time context)
  - Why it's newsworthy (context, significance)
- Click "Stop Recording" when finished

**Step 2: Generate Caption**
- Review the transcription preview
- Click "Generate Reuters Caption"
- Claude analyzes and formats using comprehensive Reuters style guide

**Step 3: Review & Copy**
- Your formatted caption appears
- Missing information is highlighted
- Click "Copy Caption" to copy to clipboard
- Or click "Add Missing Info" to refine...

**Step 4: Refine (Optional, Repeatable)**
- Record OR type additional details
- Click "Update Caption"
- New caption builds on ALL previous information
- Repeat until perfect

### Best Practices

**Speak clearly and include:**
- Full names with correct spelling
- Specific dates (not "yesterday" but "February 16, 2026")
- Exact locations (not "downtown" but "Times Square, New York")
- Context that makes it newsworthy
- Credit line photographer name

**Recording tips:**
- Minimize background noise
- Speak at normal pace
- Pause briefly between different pieces of information
- Use "Add Missing Info" for corrections

## Technical Architecture

### Native App Stack
- **pywebview**: Native window wrapper (no browser)
- **Python audio recording**: sounddevice library for microphone access
- **Flask**: Backend API server
- **JavaScript bridge**: Communication between Python and JavaScript

### AI Models
- **Whisper Large** (~1.5GB): Most accurate transcription, cached at `~/.cache/whisper/`
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Reuters caption generation via LiteLLM

### Frontend
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework overhead
- **State machine**: Clean step management
- **Toast notifications**: Non-intrusive feedback
- **Responsive CSS**: Works on all screen sizes

### Backend
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework
- **Native audio recording**: Direct microphone access
- **Whisper service**: Local transcription
- **Claude service**: Reuters-style formatting with comprehensive prompt

### API Flow
```
Native Window → Python Audio Recording → WAV file
    ↓
Whisper Large → Transcription
    ↓
Claude Sonnet 4.5 (via LiteLLM) → Formatted Caption
```

### Context Chaining
The app builds context across iterations:
```
Round 1: "Original recording"
         ↓ + details A
Round 2: "Original recording + Additional details: A"
         ↓ + details B
Round 3: "Original recording + Additional details: A + B"
```

## Sharing with Colleagues

See `HOW_TO_SHARE.md` for detailed instructions.

**Quick summary:**
1. Zip the entire folder
2. Send to colleague
3. They follow `START_HERE.md` instructions
4. API credentials automatically included (in `backend/.env`)

## Background Photos

The app features 9 rotating Reuters photos as backgrounds:
- Rugby match
- Arctic scene
- German carnival
- Lunar New Year celebrations (Indonesia, Russia, Thailand)
- Olympics (ski jumping, snowboard)
- Gaza coverage

To add more:
1. Add JPG files to `frontend/public/images/backgrounds/`
2. Update `backgroundImages` array in `frontend/public/script.js`

## Troubleshooting

### Setup Issues
- **"Python not found"**: Install Python 3 from python.org
- **Setup fails**: Make sure you have internet connection for downloads
- **Permission denied (Mac)**: Right-click script → Open → Open anyway

### App Issues
- **Window doesn't open**: Check that setup completed successfully
- **Microphone not working**: Grant microphone permissions in system settings
- **Transcription slow**: Normal for Whisper Large (~2-3 seconds per 10s audio)
- **Caption generation fails**: Check VPN connection to LiteLLM

### Common Fixes
- **Port conflict**: Close window and reopen (auto-kills old servers)
- **Whisper model missing**: Run setup script again
- **API errors**: Verify `.env` file has correct credentials

## Browser Compatibility (Dev Mode)

If running Flask directly (not via launcher):
- ✅ Chrome 90+
- ✅ Firefox 88+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- ✅ Edge 90+

## Development Notes

### Key Files to Modify

**Change Reuters prompt:**

**Add background photos:**
- Add to `frontend/public/images/backgrounds/`
- Update `backgroundImages` array in `script.js`

### Model Options

Whisper models available (change in `.env`):
- `tiny` (~39MB) - Fastest, least accurate
- `base` (~74MB) - Fast, good accuracy
- `small` (~244MB) - Medium speed, better accuracy
- `medium` (~769MB) - Slower, great accuracy
- **`large` (~1.5GB)** - Slowest, best accuracy (current)
