# How to Share This App With a Colleague

## Quick Steps

1. **Zip the entire folder**
   - Right-click the `reuters-caption-generator` folder
   - Select "Compress" (Mac) or "Send to → Compressed folder" (Windows)
   - This creates a `.zip` file

2. **Send the zip file to your colleague**
   - Via email, Slack, AirDrop, Google Drive, etc.
   - They should have everything they need!

3. **Tell them to:**
   - Unzip/Extract the folder
   - Read `START_HERE.md`
   - Follow the instructions for their operating system (Mac or Windows)

## Important Note

✅ **Your API credentials are included** in `backend/.env` - your colleague will automatically use your LiteLLM account for testing. This is totally fine for testing purposes.

## What's Included

When you zip the folder, they get:
- ✅ All the code
- ✅ The 9 Reuters background photos
- ✅ Your API credentials (in backend/.env)
- ✅ Mac setup files (in `setup-mac/` folder)
- ✅ Windows setup files (in `setup-windows/` folder)
- ✅ Clear instructions for both platforms

They just need Python 3 installed (the setup script will tell them if they don't have it).

## Platform Support

**macOS:** Complete support with `.command` scripts
**Windows:** Complete support with `.bat` scripts
**Linux:** Can use Mac scripts (they're bash-based)

## File Size

The zip will be around **40-50 MB** (mostly the background photos).

That's it! Super simple for both Mac and Windows users. 🚀
