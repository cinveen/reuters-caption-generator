# How to Share This App With a Colleague

## Quick Steps

1. **Zip the entire folder**
   - Right-click the `reuters-caption-generator` folder
   - Select "Compress"
   - This creates a `.zip` file

2. **Send the zip file to your colleague**
   - Via email, Slack, AirDrop, etc.
   - They should have everything they need!

3. **Tell them to:**
   - Unzip the folder
   - Read `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - Double-click `setup.command` (one time setup)
   - Double-click `start.command` to use the app

## Important Note

✅ **Your API credentials are included** in `backend/.env` - your colleague will automatically use your LiteLLM account for testing. This is totally fine for testing purposes.

## What's Included

When you zip the folder, they get:
- ✅ All the code
- ✅ The 9 Reuters background photos
- ✅ Your API credentials (in backend/.env)
- ✅ Setup script (setup.command)
- ✅ Launch script (start.command)
- ✅ Instructions (SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

They just need Python 3 installed (the setup script will tell them if they don't have it).

## File Size

The zip will be around **40-50 MB** (mostly the background photos).

That's it! Super simple. 🚀
